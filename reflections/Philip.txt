* What do I want to learn or understand better?
  I would like to get a better understanding of effect hooks
  (A) Currently it takes time to properly use effect hooks

  (A -> B) Get more experience and read some more about the effect hook
* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  I have gotten fairly good at writing tests using jest and react-testing-library so I can help others in the team with that.

  Last week I learned about hooks and this week I will probably not learn a lot of new stuff as the sprint will be spent finishing the last parts to get it ready for presentation
* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  As always I'm ready to teach anything that I know if anyone needs it
* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  I have been an active participant in our ceremonies e.g. our daily scrum (not every day), sprint review, and sprint planning 
* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  This week I completed the water usage page, added a way to navigate to it from the landing page, and fixed bugs in the code to prepare for the final release and demo of our project.

final reflection
* What do I want to learn or understand better?
  (A) At this point at the end of the course I have decent understanding of agile development, scrum, React, Jest, Material UI, react-testing-library and front-end web development with single page applications.
  (B) In the future I would like to learn more about agile and scrum and how that works on a larger scale with multiple teams perhaps learning more about SAFe and Lean-Agile.
    When it comes to agile development I would also like to learn more about other implementations of agile such as kanban.
    Regarding web development in the future I would like to know more about other SPA libraries and frameworks for example Vue.
  (A -> B) I am going to continue to read about and work with more techonologies and methodologies in the future.
* How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  This week has been slightly different as we have instead helped each other with preparing for the demo and writing the final report.
* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  We complete our sprints on monday morning and start a new sprint monday afternoon and since this was the last sprint I have only been a part of our final sprint review this week.
* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  This week I have helped to prepare for our demo, write and merge some final small bug fixes, as well as started working on our final report for the course.
