# Reflections Alexander Lysholm


## Week 1

I want to better understand how java can work as a webserver to interigate with webapps to make them more interactive. I also want to better understand how these types of applications are developed using both web technologies and normal languages. So far we have not done much work with scrum which we will get into more next week. If someone have trouble starting out, I can try to help them if I myself have gotten past the trouble might face when starting something new.
