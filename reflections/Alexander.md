# Reflections Alexander Lysholm

## Week 1

I want to better understand how java can work as a webserver to integrate with webapps to make them more interactive. I also want to better understand how these types of applications are developed using both web technologies and normal languages. So far we have not done much work with scrum which we will get into more next week. If someone have trouble starting out, I can try to help them if I myself have gotten past the trouble might face when starting something new.

## Week 2

The past week I've spent some time familiarizing myself with HTML, CSS, and JS and how they work together to create webpages. I think I have achieved a good grasp of the basics of HTML, and CSS, while still being quite unfamiliar with all the different HTML tags, and CSS properties, but I think this is something that I will get familiar with over time.  
This week I want to focus more on React. This is because we're going to heavily rely on React and Javascript for our website, and thus is something that I need know much better. My plan for this week to walk through a bunch of React tutorials and follow along. This should hopefully get me to better understand the React framework, while learning the javascript syntax at the same time.

On the Scrum side, we have decided to use [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), and have started breaking up a single user story into tasks and acceptance criteria. There are still quite a few user stories to break down, but we will break them down as we go and work on our SCRUM process (our first sprint will be next week).  
I will try to contribute as much as I can with the deliveries, by solving as many tasks as I can and feel comfortable with. I think this might be at a slower pace in the beginning as I'm totally new to web development, but will definetly pick up speed as I experiment more with it and learn.
