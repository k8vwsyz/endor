# Reflections Alexander Lysholm

## Week 1

I want to better understand how java can work as a webserver to integrate with webapps to make them more interactive. I also want to better understand how these types of applications are developed using both web technologies and normal languages. So far we have not done much work with scrum which we will get into more next week. If someone have trouble starting out, I can try to help them if I myself have gotten past the trouble might face when starting something new.

## Week 2

The past week I've spent some time familiarizing myself with HTML, CSS, and JS and how they work together to create webpages. I think I have achieved a good grasp of the basics of HTML, and CSS, but I'm still quite unfamiliar with all the different HTML tags, and CSS properties. However, this is something that I hopefully will grow more familiar with over time.

This week I want to focus more on React. This is because we're going to heavily rely on React and Javascript for our website, and thus is something that I need know much better. My plan for this week to follow along with a bunch of React tutorials. This should hopefully get me to better understand the React framework while learning the javascript syntax at the same time.

On the Scrum side, we have decided to use [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), and have started breaking up a single user story into tasks and acceptance criteria. There are still quite a few user stories to break down, but we will break them down as we go and work on our SCRUM process (our first sprint will be next week).  
I will try to contribute as much as I can with the deliveries, by solving as many tasks as I can and feel comfortable with. I think this might be at a slower pace in the beginning as I'm totally new to web development, but will definitely pick up speed as I experiment and learn.

## Week 3

This week I've focused on learning React, which I mentioned I wanted to do the previous week. I think I've gotten an understading of the very basics of it.  
We started our first sprint this week, which we ended with a meeting where we all explained the code we wrote so everyone could understand. There was not super much code written, but still very useful since many of us got to work practically with React for the first time. I think everyone is trying their best, sometimes it can be hard going headfirst into something you have not worked with before.  
During this next week, I want to continue focus on learning React, I will do this the same way I did the previous week, by watching videos and reading the React documentation. However I will try to be more practical with the things I learn, and applying my knowledge through userstories I get assigned.
