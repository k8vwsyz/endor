Week 1: It's been a bit confusing and it has been hard coming up with new ideas.
It's also a bit hard working with new people as we're on different levels but I view this as a learning experience.
I look forward learning more and develop our idea better in an agile way.

Week 2: We have had multiple meetings this week were we've come up with user stories as well as learned about HTML, CSS and react.
Most of us are new to web development but we are working together and getting help from others in the team, which is great. 
We're using Jira to work in an agile way.
Until next week I'll familiarize myself more with HTML, CSS and react to be able to contribute as much as I possible can before we start our first sprint.

Week 3:
*What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to understand JavaScript and React better so I can contribute to our project to the best of my abilities.

*How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By listening to group members, doing my part and offering help.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Trying to come up with user stories and breaking them into tasks.


* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
We started our first sprint this week where we did a footer for our web application. 


Week4:
*What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to understand JavaScript and React better so I can contribute to our project to the best of my abilities as well as test our code. 
*How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By listening to group members, doing my part and offering help.
* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Trying to keep the acceptance criteria and social contract.
* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
We started our second sprint this week where we tried to do a quiz but underestimated it so we did not achieve what we wanted. 

Week5:
*What do I want to learn or understand better?
I still want to learn how to test our code properly. 
*How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By listening to group members, doing my part and offering help.
* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Trying to keep the acceptance criteria and social contract.
* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
We started our third sprint this week where we've worked on our quiz and tried writing tests for it. 

Week6:
Vi närmar oss slutet på projektet vilket är både lite stressande men kul. 
Denna vecka har vi mergat det mesta till master och nu gäller det bara att fixa lite småsaker så att allt blir klart.
Mitt främsta fokus denna vecka var att skapa en informationsbox vilket vi kom långt med men tyvärr inte hann helt klart och kunde ej merga till master.
Inför nästa vecka vill jag kunna bidra så mycket jag kan så vi har ett färdigt projekt som vi är stolta över.

Week7:
Denna vecka gick ut på att knyta ihop säcken och lösa de sista problemen och detaljerna.
Vi gjorde om informationsboxen till en doneringsbox och fixade den så den kunde mergas in. 
Denna vecka gick allt mycket smidigare, dels för det inte fanns mycket nytt och komplicerat och dels för att man har en större förståelse över hur React funkar.
Det har varit roligt att se vårt projekt växa varje vecka men ännu roligare att ha det färdigt.
