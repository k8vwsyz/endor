Week 1: It's been a bit confusing and it has been hard coming up with new ideas.
It's also a bit hard working with new people as we're on different levels but I view this as a learning experience.
I look forward learning more and develop our idea better in an agile way.

Week 2: We have had multiple meetings this week were we've come up with user stories as well as learned about HTML, CSS and react.
Most of us are new to web development but we are working together and getting help from others in the team, which is great. 
We're using Jira to work in an agile way.
Until next week I'll familiarize myself more with HTML, CSS and react to be able to contribute as much as I possible can before we start our first sprint.

Week 3:
*What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to understand JavaScript and React better so I can contribute to our project to the best of my abilities.

*How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
By listening to group members, doing my part and offering help.

* What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Trying to come up with user stories and breaking them into tasks.


* What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
We started our first sprint this week where we did a footer for our web application.
