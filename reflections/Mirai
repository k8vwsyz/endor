Week 1: It's been a bit confusing and it has been hard coming up with new ideas.
It's also a bit hard working with new people as we're on different levels but I view this as a learning experience.
I look forward learning more and develop our idea better in an agile way.

Week 2: We have had multiple meetings this week were we've come up with user stories as well as learned about HTML, CSS and react.
Most of us are new to web development but we are working together and getting help from others in the team, which is great. 
We're using Jira to work in an agile way.
Until next week I'll familiarize myself more with HTML, CSS and react to be able to contribute as much as I possible can before we start our first sprint.
